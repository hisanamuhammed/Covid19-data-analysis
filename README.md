# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis with R

This project involves **web scraping and analysis of global COVID-19 data** using the **R programming language**. The goal is to explore trends in testing, infection rates, and population-level impacts across countries using **data visualization** and analysis techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Web scraped COVID-19 data globally.
- Analyzed key metrics such as:
  - **Tested/Population Ratio**
  - **Confirmed/Tested Ratio**
  - **Confirmed/Population Ratio**
- Generated various visualizations using `ggplot2`:
  - Top 10 countries by infection rate.
  - Testing intensity vs. Confirmed rate.
  - Bar plots, scatter plots.
- Filtered and analyzed data to highlight insights for **highly tested countries**.
